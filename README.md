The Application has been exported to a standalone folder
and can only run on windows x64 based systems

**To run:**
 - Open the Sudoku Folder
 - Run Sudoku.exe

**To use:**
This game is keyboard based. To trigger any event a relevant
key (the application will point out which keys to use) must be
pressed.

**To not break:**
 - Do not resize or fullscreen the terminal (you may move it)
 - Do not minimimze the application
These will not immediately break the program but probably will at 
one point since the application relies on terminal coordinates.
Also try to avoid temporarily exiting the application, this may
decrease its speed dramatically.

**Finally:**
 - Have fun
